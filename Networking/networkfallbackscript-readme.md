The NetworkFallbackScript is used to keep check on internet connectivity, and switch to an (emergency) fallback connection in case no connection can be made for a longer period of time.
This is useful if for example, you have a dedicated headless (no console) machine that only has a single network adapter, but requires some complex network configuration that's prone to break with updates and alike.
Note you should edit the script to fit your own use case. By default it'll try and bring up/down some networks with nmcli which are probably not present on your machine, and also only has a timeout of 5 seconds, which is probably too little for most.
